# Bible Study Notetaking App

This is the first app that I made that saw frequent use on my devices.  Some of the key features:
- Persists data using CoreData
- CRUD actions on the data
- Allows for full text formatting (bold, font-size, paste text with formatting, etc.)
- Ability to output notes to various programs
